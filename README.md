# Tic-Tac-Toe

I made use of 2D arrays to create the grid and implement click listeners on them. There will be two players who will go on their respective turns.
Either player 1 wins or player 2 wins or itâ€™s a draw. Their individual scores will be calculated on top, whoever wins a particular game, gets a point. 
The reset button will clear all the points and the players can start the game again.

## Technologies used
